# FlatZoneGenerator
A Python script that endlessly generates remixes of the song Flat Zone 2 from Super Smash Bros Brawl.

To use, download the repository (including the sound files), open the folder in terminal or command prompt and use
    python generator.py
to run the script. The script will keep running as long as you let it, so use ctrl+c to pause execution and stop the music.

I put in lag compensation based on how it ran on my machine, so there might be some track overlap or lag between tracks on other machines.
